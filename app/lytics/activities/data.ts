    description: `Experience the ancient healing art of our "Volcanic Warmth Therapy." This specialized treatment utilizes smooth, heated basalt stones harvested from local volcanic islands, known for their ability to retain heat and transfer grounding energy. The session begins with a consultation to identify your specific areas of tension. Our therapists then skillfully place the warm stones on key energy points along your spine, palms, and feet to promote deep relaxation and balance the body's chakras.

The heat from the stones penetrates deep into the muscle layers, melting away stiffness and stress more effectively than manual massage alone. This is combined with rhythmic Swedish massage strokes using warm organic coconut and frangipani oils, leaving your skin soft and nourished. Ideal for those suffering from chronic back pain, insomnia, or simply the fatigue of travel, this treatment takes place in our open-air pavilions, allowing the gentle sound of ocean waves to lull you into a state of pure bliss.`,
